Below is a **clean, structured “master prompt”** you can give to an AI UI/code generator (like v0, Cursor, Bolt, etc.) to build the **final ExplainMyCode interface exactly as you described**. I merged your **initial spec + final feature map** into one consistent product prompt.

You can copy-paste this directly.

# Master Prompt — ExplainMyCode IDE

Design and build a **premium AI-powered coding IDE called “ExplainMyCode.”**

The product is an **AI mentor for programmers** that explains code, detects bugs, highlights assumptions, and visualizes algorithms.

The interface should feel like a hybrid of:

* VS Code
* GitHub Copilot
* ChatGPT

The UI should be a **modern SaaS developer platform** with a **clean futuristic dark theme**.

Focus on **developer productivity, clarity, and a premium experience**.

---

# Overall Layout

The interface must use a **3-panel IDE layout** similar to professional code editors.

```

```

The panel should be scrollable.

---

# AI Mentor Tabs

## Comments (Real-time)

Line-by-line comments generated automatically while typing.

Updates every **1.5 seconds pause**.

Each line shows a card.

Example:

```
Line 3 — Loop iterates through array
Line 7 — Condition checks if value exists
```

Color coding:

Blue → informational
Green → important logic
Yellow → warning

Powered by Groq.

---

## Summary

A short paragraph explaining what the entire program does.

Example:

```
This program performs binary search on a sorted list
to efficiently locate a target value.
```

Generated when the user clicks **Explain Code**.

---

## Explanation (Section-Based)

Large code must be split into logical sections.

Example:

```
Lines 1-4 — Setup
Lines 5-10 — Loop
Lines 11-15 — Return value
```

User clicks a section button → detailed explanation appears.

Small programs can be explained fully.

---

## Bugs

Displays detected bugs as cards.

Example:

```
🐛 Line 7 — Runtime Bug
Division by zero possible if b = 0

⚠️ Line 12 — Logic Bug
Loop runs one extra time (off-by-one)
```

---

## Assumptions

Shows hidden assumptions in the code.

Example:

```
📌 Input Assumption
Assumes user never enters negative numbers

📌 Data Assumption
Assumes array is already sorted
```

---

# Am I On Track Bar

Full width bar at the bottom of the IDE.

Displays real-time feedback about the code.

Examples:

```
🟢 Looks good! Your loop logic is correct
Python • 12 lines • 0 bugs

🟡 Warning — variable defined but unused
Python • 8 lines • 1 warning

🔴 Error — division by zero on line 7
Python • 15 lines • 1 error
```

Updates automatically every **1.5 seconds pause**.

Powered by Groq.

# Empty State

When the editor has no code:

```
Welcome to ExplainMyCode

Paste or write code to get instant AI explanations.

Supported languages:
Python • JavaScript • C++ • Java
```

Include a **Try Sample Code button**.

---

# Backend APIs Used

The system should integrate these APIs:

Groq → real-time comments + On Track bar
Claude → summary, explanations, bugs, assumptions
Judge0 → code execution for terminal

---

# Goal

Create a **polished AI-powered developer IDE** that feels like a real product combining:

VS Code
GitHub Copilot
ChatGPT

The system should feel like a **smart programming mentor that explains and analyzes code in real time**.

---

If you want, I can also give you a **second prompt specifically for generating the full backend architecture (FastAPI + Groq + Claude + Judge0)** so your **AI IDE actually works end-to-end**.
